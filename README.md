# mysql-benchmark_suite
Three-Server-Suite to run MySQL on one server, 
query the MySQL instance from another server and 
retrieve benchmarking results from a third master server.

This project emerged during the work on [htmsql](https://github.com/Meash/htmsql), 
a Bachelor's Thesis investigating core performance indicators of Hardware Transactional Memory 
and its application to MySQL's storage engine InnoDB.
